# 🐍 Snake2D — Snake Game in C++ and OpenGL

**Snake2D** is my personal take on the classic Snake game, built from scratch in C++ using OpenGL.  
This is not a tutorial — it’s a live, evolving devlog project. I document the entire process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0ihJsga7stVBUiUKi2RhQcPLLUCcEJWz), and you’re welcome to follow, suggest features, and download the game.
